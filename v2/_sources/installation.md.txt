# Installation

## Requirements

OpenNMT-tf requires:

* Python >= 3.5
* TensorFlow 2.0

Some features added after the initial release may require newer TensorFlow versions. Please consult the changelog to know about new features availability.

## Via pip (recommended)

Each tagged version of the project is automatically pushed to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/OpenNMT-tf/). We recommend installing this package via `pip`:

```bash
pip install --pre OpenNMT-tf
```

To confirm that the package is correctly installed, run:

```bash
onmt-main -h
```
